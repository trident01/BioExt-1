Some tips for working with the BioExt package

IMPORTANT - A note about running the scripts - I changed their names to end with '.py'. I had to do this to import functions from a few of them, and wanted the naming to remain consistent. Run these from the command line by typing their name (ex. 'bealign.py') with necessary and optional arguments. Use the -h argument to show a list of these. Just typing 'bealign' will not work (or will not run the latest version). 

To setup, from the command line run "python setup.py build; python setup.py install". Any changes made to the code will be present after this setup.
